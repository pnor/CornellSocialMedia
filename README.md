## Project Requirements
### iOS
* The iOS portion of the project must contain the following components that have learned in class:
AutoLayout using NSLayoutConstraint or SnapKit
All Views were constructed using SnapKit.
* Use a UICollectionView or UITableView
Main Feed, Commnents, and People Search utilize a UICollectionView.
* Use some form of navigation
The user can use either the navigation bar or swipe gestures to navigate the app.
### Backend
* Designing an API, using database modeling, and implementing it using the Flask boilerplate code provided - it’s totally fine to write a wrapper for an existing API. Consider what changes you will need to fit the iOS client’s needs and how to model the data appropriately in a database. 
Used SQL Alchemy to model a user, with information like username, password, year, major, college, netID, image and more information. 
* Deployment to Google Cloud 
Used Google Cloud.
